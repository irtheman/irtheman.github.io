# NAVAIR
## January 2019 - November 2019
<hr class="hr-plain">

NAVAIR was a government job. There isn't really much Matthew can talk about though some very general topics might be possible.

In this job, Matthew was filling various roles with the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWC-WD) for developing, maintaining and converting legacy code to DotNet Core and micro-services for future improvements that would hopefully assist those who serve our country.

Projects:  
- E2-C/D involved helping to maintain JMPS software add-ins, eventually converting to .NET and the future goal of moving to micro-services. Coding involved ADA95, MS C++ 6.0, and VB6.
- SPEARR involved supporting innovative experiments that required DotNet Core experience, micro-services development and working toward utilizing Kafka as an Event-Sourcing repository and eventual replacement for the commonly used very large dynamic MSSQL database. His tasks included fully understanding micro-services architecture, documenting important design patterns & standards, orchestration, messaging, logging, monitoring, utilization of Docker in both Linux and Windows environments, and planning for testing via unit-testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Implementation including experimenting with many databases, C# framework and core, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, REACT, and even making COM work in a docker container.

**Pros:**
* There were lots of government courses that one would be paid for doing as a break from work
* There were more learning opportunities like skill courses in problem solving, communication, etc.
* New opportunities to demonstrate modern technology that could one day, maybe a few years out, be utilized

**Cons:**
* Per the on-base therapist, there were numerous narcissists (co-workers and staff), psychopaths (a supervisor) and an actual known sociopath (not encountered)
* Frequent damage to personal property (car, computer, books, etc) while on base
* Physical assault including being pushed down stairs and threats to find one in the parking lot
