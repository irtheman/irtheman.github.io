<hr class="hr-plain">

### History
Matthew Hanna, an introvert, lives in Alexandria, VA, as of August 2020. He started life in West Virginia and bounced up and down the east coast for a quite a while. Eventually Matthew started college at Coastal Carolina University in 1992. He was already well experienced in computers and programming, so he ended up actually running a lab and filling the role of teacher's assistant in a few courses. There were a few ups-and-downs along the way, but he was still happy. Not long after graduating Matthew then moved on to a short effort at acquiring a Masterâ€™s Degree in Theoretical Computer Science at Clemson University around 1999. How fun! Upon graduation his software engineering career kicked off starting in Rhode Island, moving to California, and now lives in Virginia.

### Hardware
Matthew currently has 3 Dell XPS computers with 32GB memory, 1TB SSD, and a 5TB secondary hard drives. There is also a compatible laptop, Dell Inspiron, also running 32GB memory and a 250GB SSD. They are all using Nvidia graphics cards with CUDA Machine Learning tools. Such wonderful equipment! There is also a DIY NAS with 20TB of storage in his home as well.

### Personal Projects
For fun and entertainment, Matthew maintains several personal websites and is developing his own online writing / blog service which will be an open source project when it is ready. A second project involves writing ray-tracing applications in various programming languages for the personal experience to learn those languages. A third project is to utilize Machine Learning and LLMs for various purposes. The custom made SLM with triggers is finally running on his cellphone.

In the past, Matthew was maintaining a FreeStyle Libre AI that monitored the metrics of a diabetic including insulin usage, foods and drinks consumed, exercise, ketone levels and a number of n-1 trials that could be conducted by the user. A second project involved a heads-up display for Matthew's car that provided directions, control of the cellphone without contact, and lane-departure / collision warnings.

### Hobbies
Things Matthew likes to do include mindfulness, yoga, hiking, photography, programming, caring for exotic animals such as rabbits & raccoons, volunteering for animal care like kittens & puppies, reading, drawing, journaling and electronics projects (mostly tesla coils). There is rarely boredom because he is always coming up with plenty of new project ideas as well.
