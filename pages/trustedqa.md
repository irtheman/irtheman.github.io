# TrustedQA
## July 2021 - June 2022
<hr class="hr-plain">

TrustedQA is a proven leader in providing high-quality and innovative IT modernization solutions and professional services.  As a Small Business established in 1988, their unwavering mission continues to be helping customers in both the U.S. Government and commercial industry build and deliver quality systems more efficiently, effectively, and securely. 

TrustedQA was a subcontractor for Spalding who was a contractor for the USA Navy service called NavAir. The work Matthew did involved maintaining a few specific Navy website applications using JavaScript (require.js, knockout, react, jQuery,
etc.), Node.js, C#, and SQL. Deployment was done using various means but the final, and best deployment, was using OpenShift as a deployment pipeline involving Jenkins, Docker, NexusIQ and other services.

**Pros (TrustedQA):**
* Matthew's second attempt at remote work further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic
* Very nice management that really did care about their employees
* Ready to help on demand
* A growing business with lots of potential
* Frequent offers to do extra work to help TrustedQA with promises for overtime pay

**Pros (Spalding -> Navy):**
* Initially open to new ideas
* Very friendly management
* Pretty good retirement benefits
* Promises of new innovative projects coming

**Cons (TrustedQA):**
* Health benefits were not so great but better than other jobs from the past

**Cons (Spalding -> Navy):**
* Project lead quit their job thus promoting a fellow co-worker to the new role which significantly changed the "job description"
* Other co-workers would join and quickly leave. At a certain point, there were only 2 programmers left on the project
* Two cases of Nepotism in yet another government project
* Observed leadership fire a person due to them having seizures that were not under control yet which felt a little scary and merciless
