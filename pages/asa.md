AEA was an environmental research and development company.

As his first real-world job, Matthew developed and maintained numerous GIS applications and tools, including desktop, thin client, and Web services while also helping to maintain the office’s computers and networks. He provided innovative cutting-edge tools and utilities for ESRI ArcGIS 8.2 – 9.2 that easily added local- and Web-based data sources not previously available. There was also the creative addition of true animation and time-line extensions that permitted animating any GIS layer with a date and/or time metadata field(s) present and provided methods to create, edit and display geo-mapped data like vector, scalar, geographic shapes, NetCDF, OpenDAP, GRIB and HDF. Matthew also added support for custom WMS layers and simplified WFS layers. He also helped implement the addition of near real-time SOAP messages system to communicate data from another client that would update custom layers on the ArcMap application with search and rescue data.

Matthew created interactive Web-based visualization tools and services and utilized HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, C#, Flash 7+, and Flex 2. He aggregated, served, and displayed data such as NetCDF, WMS, WFS, WCS, ArcIMS, Yahoo Maps, Google Maps, Microsoft Live, and other formats. Matthew also implemented C/C++ and C# COM objects for accessing other APIs from Visual Basic 6. There was also developing code for 3D visualization of underwater terrain, GIS objects, scalar data, wind and water vector fields, plumes, and particle systems using GDI, DirectX, and OpenGL. All implementation was in the form of programming libraries based off RFCs and white papers.

**Pros:**
* This was Matthew's first programming and ETL (Extract / Transform / Load) job
* Plenty of learning opportunities (management courses, ESRI courses, VB6, DirectX, Flash and more)
* Creativity was a huge score
* No competitive programming
* No demand for charisma talk
* Really friendly co-workers who enjoyed exchanging knowledge

**Cons:**
* Nepotism caused a conflict with a "special" co-worker
