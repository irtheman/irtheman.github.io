# Circuit City
## June 2007 - January 2008
<hr class="hr-plain">

This Circuit City was an independently owned business that closed in 2018.

Working at Circuit City, Matthew was hired to work no a desktop application. He ended up being moved web development, implemented various Web controls for ASP.Net. He also developed plug-ins for their WordPress website and a Java-based multi-file upload control, all running on a Linux platform, using PHP and MySQL per the client specifications.

**Pros:**
* First job in California
* Entertaining problems to solve for the client

**Cons:**
* Very low salary with no benefits
* Many co-workers quit fast because I wasn't aware of the store closing soon
