# Omnigo
## August 2020 - July 2021
<hr class="hr-plain">

Omnigo was formed when three companies — ITI Technologies, iView Systems, and ReportExec — were brought together as one in 2017. 360 Stay Safe was added to the Omnigo portfolio in 2018. Omnigo is made up of former law enforcement, dispatch, security, and other experienced professionals with a shared vision: to ensure a world with safer tomorrows. This is what attracted Matthew's attention.

Projects:  
- TraQStudio is a local application that Matthew helped maintain. It is often running on the client computer that interacts with their Omnigo web service.
- TraQ6 is another product Matthew helped maintain. It is the original TraQ product produced by QueTel which was acquired by Omnigo.
- TraQ7 is the newer TraQ product that Matthew contributed to and also helped maintain. It includes multi-tenant capabilities so one service can be shared with multiple clients. Redis cache service was integrated by Matthew in a manner that can be easily enabled or disabled per client requirements.
- Tenant Portal is a new service Matthew developed that enables maintaining Service Activation Keys and additional client information that can be shared by other projects at Omnigo.
- Matthew Hanna assisted many clients with using the API Integration built into TraQ6 and TraQ7 allowing for the import and export of data.

**Pros:**
* First remote job for Matthew (difficult to get used to especially during the COVID-19 pandemic)
* The team grew very quickly; from 3 people to 7+
* Cutting edge technology is really fun
* The new products were expanding to hosting multiple tenants (customers) on a single cloud based platform rather than an on-premise server thus providing greater reliability and speed of service

**Cons:**
* Health and retirement benefits were pretty low
* Very little documentation other than short Help PDFs provided to clients
* To many variants of one older product making it almost impossible to help clients
* One manager out of 2, the subject matter expert, quit their job leaving everyone hanging
* Another manager, the backup subject matter expert, moved to another far away country for remote work making getting assistance much more difficult
