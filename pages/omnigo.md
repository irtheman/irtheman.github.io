# Omnigo
## August 2020 - Present
------

Omnigo was formed when three companies—ITI Technologies, iView Systems, and ReportExec—were brought together as one in 2017. 360 Stay Safe was added to the Omnigo portfolio in 2018. Omnigo is made up of former law enforcement, dispatch, security, and other experienced professionals with a shared vision: to ensure a world with safer tomorrows. This is what attracted Matthew's attention.

Projects:  
- TraQStudio is a local application that Matthew helped maintain. It is often running on the client computer that interacts with their Omnigo web service.
- TraQ6 is another product Matthew helped maintain. It is the original TraQ product produced by QueTel which was acquired by Omnigo.
- TraQ7 is the newer TraQ product that Matthew contributed to and also helped maintain. It includes multi-tenant capabilities so one service can be shared with multiple clients. Redis cache service was integrated by Matthew in a manner that can be easily enabled or disabled per client requirements.
- Tenant Portal is a new service Matthew developed that enables maintaining Service Activation Keys and additional client information that can be shared by other projects at Omnigo.
