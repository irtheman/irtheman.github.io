<hr class="hr-plain">

Aerovironment manufactured and tested a variety of drones for the military.

In this role, Matthew performed software design, programming, and maintenance in C#, VB.Net, C, and C++ for various existing and newly developed applications. The job involved handled maintenance and implementation of FalconView Map Application plugins used for communicating with simulators and actual Small Unmanned Air Vehicles (SUAVs) using serial, UDP, and TCP protocols that were both open and proprietary.

Some of the most fun tasks involved developing object-oriented flight simulators in C# and Unity3D. There was also creating various software libraries for DTED, UDP packet communications, and debugging / testing tools. Matthew also develop a unique, simple to use, GIS desktop application supporting dozens of map types and geo-referenced entities. These programs and libraries involving implementing  programming libraries based off ICDs, RFCs, and white papers. This job also included working with embedded Linux and Windows operating systems.

**Pros:**
* A wide variety of projects to work on
* Creativity was always wanted and time was given for coming up with ideas
* A very friendly group of co-workers
* Awesome technology to learn and utilize
* Frequent travel to various military bases for demonstrations
* No demand for charisma talk

**Cons:**
* Some shortly employed co-workers were overly competitive (rock-stars) who would break projects
* A manager was a control freak who couldn't handle being proven wrong
* The company "died" very quickly with up to 6 waves of layoffs when they sold out
