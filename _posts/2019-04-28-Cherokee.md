<a class="no-tufte-underline" href="/cherokee/"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"/> (details)</a> The <a href="https://cherokee-federal.com/" target="_blank">Cherokee Federal</a> was a contractor for USGS WARC for legacy internet services conversion to modern services and maintenance in Microsoft Power Apps, C#, ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework Core including scaffolding, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS / SCSS, and Gulp. Limited usage of third-party libraries was stated as a requirement so many custom variations were created. Plenty of team work on projects.
