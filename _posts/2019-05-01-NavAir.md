<a class="no-tufte-underline" href="/navair/"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"/></a> The <a href="https://www.navair.navy.mil" target="_blank">NAVAIR</a> job involved SECDEVOPS using .NET Framework, .NET Core, ASP.NET, NGINX, Node.JS, Docker, MSSQL, MySQL, Postgres and numerous other support micro-services. Matthew also performed important maintenance on older code written in VB6, C/C++, Java, .Net Framework, ADA95 and SQL. A standout task involved prototyping a way to replace the standard SQL database with Kafka for much faster speed and synchronization. Working with 20+ coworkers was enjoyable. Not much more can be said about this job.
