<a class="no-tufte-underline" href="/smartronix/"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"/></a> Working for <a href="https://smartronix.com" target="_blank">Smartronix</a>, Matthew supported the ETIRMS project with the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWC-WD), Point Mugu, CA. The role involved software engineering, testing and maintenance for EA-6B Prowler, EA-18G/E Growler, FA-18, AEA, HARM, EWDS, Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), micro-services, and projects using mostly C# and VB6. Standout tasks involved exact conversion of VB6 to C# and synchronization of large remote databases using kafka. Working with 20+ coworkers was enjoyable.
